    <h4>
      Potatoes are still a staple at most mealtimes, with traditional dishes
      remaining popular. Colcannon is a classic, comforting mash of potatoes,
      cabbage (or kale) and butter (or cream), flavoured with spring onions.
      Champ is a similar, mashed potato favourite, flavoured with spring onions,
      milk and butter.

    <h4>
      The biggest and most spectacular of all Ireland’s festivals, St Patrick’s
      Day in March is celebrated with parades of marching bands, town
      dignitaries, schools, local clubs and law enforcement. Every town and
      village in the Republic has its own event, and ‘wearing of the green’ is
      seen all over the land. Dublin’s parade is the best, while the pubs serve
      green Guinness to revelers all night long.
